## Bouncing Ball Demo

# Note:

I'm using the latest (very unstable) version of [Compass](http://compass-style.org) to get animation mixins.

**Compass 0.13.alpha.10 (Markab)**

On OSX it needs to run as root: `sudo compass watch`

# Why this demo?

It's a small [SASS](sass-lang.com) excercise to show:
- @import
- @variables
- Useful @mixins
